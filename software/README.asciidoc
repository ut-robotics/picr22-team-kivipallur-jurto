## Steps to run the code.

NOTE: the code can be ran without a referee server and started with a controller +
      Our code is based on {1}[BootCampCode] +
      referee server can be found from {2}[HERE] +


[horizontal]
1. Configuring all the colours with file config_colors.py +
2. If a different robot is used change wheelRadius and wheelDistanceFromCenter in MainMovement.py +
3. Update the robotID in main.py +
4. Update the ip and port in ref_commands.py +
5. Start up the referee server or connect a controller +
6. Run main.py +
